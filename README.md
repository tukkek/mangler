# Code mangler

**Mangler** is an opinionated code-formatter for CSS; HTML; and Java-script [^1]. You can access it here: https://tukkek.github.io/mangler/

Its opinions are:

1. *While every-one was busy writing frame-works, Java-script became a damn good language[^2]!*
2. If you can't write Java-script code that is concise, short and beautiful, the onus is on you.
3. If you can't read short and concise Java-script code, the onus is on you.
   - Especially with editor commodity-features like syntax-highlighting, folding, matching...
4. If you are spamming need-less braces, new-lines and semi-colons, you're doing it wrong.
5. Every-single-thing in The Zen of Python[^3].

Programming-languages have come a long way since the days of Fortran; Lisp; and C. The two most-popular languages today: Java-script and Python[^4], make it trivially easy to write short; concise; vertical; good modular[^5] code with minimal boiler-plate getting in the way[^6], especially as they continue developing and enhancing their syntaxes[^7].

While the output of Mangler isn't necessarily meant to be copy-pasted as-is into a project, it can be used as a starting-point to be minimally-modified before doing so.
